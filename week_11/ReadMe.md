This repository contains all required files for the Week 11 assignment on XGBoost Comparative Analysis, including R and Python code, synthetic datasets, and the final report.
However, due to GitHubâ€™s 25MB file size upload limit, the file `synthetic_data_10000000.rds` (10 million rows) was not uploaded. Although the dataset was generated and used locally for the assignment as required, and results were included in the final report wherever applicable.
