Week 3 Assignment: Distance Profiling on Python and R

Overview:- 

This assignment consists of profiling execution times of various methods of computing geospatial distances through Python and R. The task assesses a number of implementations such as loops, apply functions and vectorized computations to make performance tradeoffs between runtime and implementation complexity.

Files Included
Python
Week_03_Assignment.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing various ways of computing distances and timer results.

Methods implemented:

Manual for-loop

Iterrows with Haversine function

Pandas apply() function

NumPy vectorized calculation

R
Week_03.Rmd: RMarkdown file mimicking a Python loop logic, as well as increasing performance using two more methods.

Week_03_R_Code.html: HTML output produced with results of microbenchmarks.

Methods implemented:

Nested sapply() loop

apply() with custom Haversine function

Fully vectorized matrix calculation

Report
Week3_Assignment.pdf.: Observed python and r performance results based summary document answering the 4 assignment questions.

Instructions
Open, and run Week_03_Assignment.ipynb to profile Python distance methods.

Rerun benchmark results in Knit week_03.Rmd in RStudio.

For written analysis of detailed comparison of performance, implementation, and environment preference, review Week3_Assignment.pdf.
